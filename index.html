		There is a giant mis-understanding when it comes to human understanding, general problem solving, economic views, and many other interpreted fields but the most misunderstood field of study, even by the most accademically inclined, is human development. From society being consisted of hunter/getherers to societies based on profit and growth the basis of human development is the same while the society/ethics/knowledge have changed over thousands of years. The basis of human development is that all humans are made of the enviornment, physcially and psychologically.
